Where to start learning kubernetes?

Goal:
    The goal I want to achieve is to load balance the resources on two virtual machines and one physical machine so a docker container app can use the load balanced resources. 
        => I would like to use kubernetes to achieve this load balance, how would I start and get this done?

Practice: 
    Create a Main Service that shares a piece of the 2 Sub Services.

Microwave: 
    2 Hot Pockets 
        => Cooked
